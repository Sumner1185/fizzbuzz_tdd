# FizzBuzz

Fizzbuzz is the classic game introduced to most of us at a very young age to develop our maths skills that was usually later revised as a university drinking game! The basic idea is to count upwards from 1 and replace any number divisible buy 3 with the word "Fizz", any number divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz" and any word divisible by both 3 and 5 with "fizzBuzz". Otherwise you just say the number.

Should you go wrong (as a child) the game would end, usually followed by ridicule from your fellow classmates. In the later years, a wrong move would subsequently be followed by a shot of some description or a number of fingers of whatever drink was your tipple of choice (or how wasted you were looking to get!)

This programme is designed as a cheat sheet to avoid embarassment from classmates or ending up in a heap on the floor.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.
